Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no money
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on stuff, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the
stuff and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the world;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my life; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin dance, and bringing up the rear of every person I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the world, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's stuff off—then, I account it high time to get to him as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all things in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the stuff with me.
